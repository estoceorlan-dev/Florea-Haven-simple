# Floréa Haven

Floréa Haven is a storefront for seeds, flowers, and botanical perfumes. **HTML, plain CSS, and vanilla JavaScript provide the interface; Python Flask provides the entire backend; PostgreSQL stores the data.**

Each page is a standalone HTML document. JavaScript handles live API data and actions; it does not generate page markup. There is no React, Tailwind compiler, application bundler, or JavaScript router. The original React project is preserved separately. Start with the [teammate guide](docs/teammate-guide.md), [HTML page decision](docs/decisions/0005-plain-html-pages.md), and [migration record](docs/frontend-migration.md).

Implemented features include the public catalog, cookie authentication, persistent carts, Cash on Delivery checkout, customer order history, administrator catalog, inventory, order and user management, and managed profile/product image uploads.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12 or newer (verified locally with Python 3.14)
- Node.js 22+ and npm 10+ for command wrappers, checks, and copying release files
- PostgreSQL 16+ (Docker Compose configuration included)

## Local setup

```bash
npm install
npm run backend:setup
```

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` only if you do not already have a configured `.env`. Set a stable, random `JWT_SECRET`; generate one with `python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(48))"`.

For a new Docker database, start Docker Desktop and run:

```bash
npm run db:setup
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:4000`. Flask serves the HTML files and `/api` together; there is one development server. Save an HTML, CSS, or JavaScript file and refresh the browser to see it. PostgreSQL is published on port **5433** to coexist with a native PostgreSQL installation on port 5432.

For an existing database, configure `DATABASE_URL` and run `npm run db:migrate` before `npm run dev`. Seeding refreshes sample catalog records, so use `npm run db:seed` only when you want that sample data refreshed.

PostgreSQL is required. `npm run dev` starts Flask and serves the editable files in `client/`; it does not start the database. Opening HTML with `file://` cannot provide login, live products, or checkout.

The setup command creates `backend/.venv` without requiring shell activation. Set `PYTHON` to a Python executable if the default `python` (Windows) or `python3` (other platforms) is not the intended installation. Runtime dependencies are in `backend/requirements.txt`; the tested dependency versions are pinned in `backend/constraints.txt`.

## Initial administrator

Set `ADMIN_NAME`, `ADMIN_EMAIL`, and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` in your uncommitted `.env`, then run:

```bash
npm run admin:create
```

This creates the administrator or updates the name, password, and role of the account with that email. It does not print credentials. Run migrations first.

## User management

Open **Admin → Users** (`/admin/users`) to search accounts by name or email, filter by role/status, create customers or administrators, edit names/emails/roles, and deactivate or reactivate accounts. Deactivation preserves carts and order history, blocks login, and permanently revokes existing sessions. Reactivated users must sign in again. Administrators cannot demote or deactivate their own account; concurrent changes also preserve administrator access.

Apply migration `007_user_management.sql` with `npm run db:migrate` before starting the updated app. Existing accounts remain active and existing sessions remain compatible until the account is deactivated.

## Testing

Tests use `TEST_DATABASE_URL`, falling back to `DATABASE_URL`. The database user needs permission to create schemas. Each test creates a random `florea_test_...` schema, applies migrations and seeds there, and removes only that schema afterward. Existing application tables are never truncated.

```powershell
# Optional: use a separate database for tests.
$env:TEST_DATABASE_URL = 'postgresql://florea:florea@localhost:5433/florea_haven'
npm test
npm run lint
npm run build
```

Tests cover sessions, permissions, catalog administration, cart ownership, checkout, immutable order snapshots, status transitions, concurrent purchases, duplicate submissions, cancellation, and transaction rollback. Compatibility fixtures verify password hashes, JWTs, cart revisions, and order fingerprints generated by the original Express backend.

## Production serving

Build the frontend, install Python dependencies, apply migrations, and run Waitress. The production process does not need Node.js; npm is an optional command wrapper.

```bash
npm run build
python -m pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
python backend/manage.py migrate
python backend/manage.py serve
```

Set `APP_ENV=production`, `DATABASE_URL`, a stable `JWT_SECRET`, and `CLIENT_ORIGIN` to the public HTTPS origin. `PORT` defaults to 4000. Place the service behind a TLS-terminating host or reverse proxy. Flask serves the built assets and frontend deep links; `/api` remains on the same origin. Waitress is the production server; Flask's development server is for local work.

Set `DATABASE_SSL=true` when the database requires TLS. This uses certificate and hostname verification; configure `PGSSLROOTCERT` if the provider requires a custom CA. A PostgreSQL connection URL can also specify its own SSL settings.

The default authentication rate limiter uses process memory. Use one Waitress process initially. Before scaling to multiple processes/instances, configure `RATELIMIT_STORAGE_URI` to shared storage and install its corresponding storage dependency. If configuring forwarded client IPs, trust only the actual reverse proxy.

## Database compatibility

Ordered SQL migrations and the seed file live under `backend/`. Migration names and the database ledger are preserved: existing accounts, products, carts, and orders do not require conversion. Preserve your `DATABASE_URL` and `JWT_SECRET` to retain data and existing sessions.

The `florea_session` cookie, bcrypt hashes, HS256 JWTs, API routes, JSON envelopes, and client API calls remain compatible with existing data. See [the frontend migration](docs/frontend-migration.md) for the current interface and validation.

## Render release

Use [the Render deployment runbook](docs/render-deployment.md) with [render.yaml](render.yaml). It provisions a paid Docker web service, private PostgreSQL, and shared rate limiting in Singapore. The build serves the vanilla frontend and Flask on one HTTPS origin; migrations run before deployment. Set the three server-only `CLOUDINARY_*` credentials in Render. No production resources have been provisioned by the repository setup.

`npm run check` runs lint, backend/component tests, the production build, and desktop/mobile browser journeys. Install Chromium first with `npx playwright install chromium`. Browser tests create and drop an isolated PostgreSQL schema; Cloudinary calls are stubbed. `compose.smoke.yml` provides a disposable Linux production stack with real PostgreSQL and Redis; see the runbook for commands.

Image uploads use authenticated multipart endpoints, byte-level validation, metadata stripping, responsive Cloudinary delivery, and a durable cleanup queue. Run `npm run images:cleanup` locally or `python backend/manage.py cleanup-images` on the host daily. See [ADR 0003](docs/decisions/0003-managed-images-and-render.md) for the upload protocol decision and [release status](docs/release-status.md) for verification and launch prerequisites.

Never commit `.env` or production credentials. Real Cloudinary delivery, Render HTTPS, backups, and hosted smoke tests must be verified in staging before launch. Figma comparison and full assistive-technology review remain separate release-review items.
