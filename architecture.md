# Floréa Haven — System Architecture

## 1. Project Overview

**Floréa Haven** is a small e-commerce web application for selling seeds, flowers, and perfumes. The system allows customers to browse products, search and filter items, manage a shopping cart, place orders, and view their order history. Administrators can manage products, inventory, and orders, including the customer details needed for fulfillment.

The architecture is intentionally kept simple and suitable for a student project while following a clear separation between the frontend, backend, and database.

## 2. Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend | React.js | Build the interactive user interface |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS | Responsive and aesthetic UI styling |
| Backend | Python + Flask | REST API and server-side business logic |
| Database | PostgreSQL | Store users, products, orders, and related data |
| Hosting | Python WSGI host + HTTPS proxy | Serve Flask and the built React application |
| API Communication | REST API / JSON | Communication between React and Flask |
| Authentication | JWT | Secure user authentication and authorization |
| Version Control | Git + GitHub | Source-code management and collaboration |

> **Backend migration:** [ADR 0002](docs/decisions/0002-python-flask-backend.md) replaces Express with Flask and Psycopg. React and the PostgreSQL schema are retained. PostgreSQL is required for development and tests.

---

## 5. Backend Architecture

The Python Flask backend provides the REST API and contains the application's business logic.

The implemented backend is organized by feature:

```text
backend/
  florea/
    __init__.py     Flask factory, JSON handling, security headers, frontend serving
    auth.py         Passwords, JWT cookies, roles, authentication rate limits
    catalog.py      Public catalog and administrator category/product operations
    cart.py         Persistent cart and revision calculation
    orders.py       Checkout, customer history, fulfillment, transactional cancellation
    validation.py  Request validation and normalized inputs
    db.py          Psycopg connections and transaction helpers
    errors.py      API error envelope helpers
  migrations/      Ordered SQL files and existing migration ledger
  seeds/           Catalog seed data
  tests/           PostgreSQL integration and compatibility tests
  manage.py        Server and database commands
```

### Backend Responsibilities

- Receive and validate API requests.
- Authenticate users.
- Authorize administrator functions.
- Retrieve and modify product data.
- Manage inventory.
- Create and update orders.
- Validate checkout information.
- Communicate with PostgreSQL.
- Return JSON responses to the React frontend.
- Handle API errors consistently.

---

## 6. REST API Structure

The API can be organized around the main resources of the application.

### Authentication

```text
POST   /api/auth/register
POST   /api/auth/login
GET    /api/auth/me
```

### Products

```text
GET    /api/products
GET    /api/products/:id
POST   /api/products
PUT    /api/products/:id
DELETE /api/products/:id
```

### Categories

```text
GET    /api/categories
POST   /api/categories
PUT    /api/categories/:id
DELETE /api/categories/:id
```

### Cart

```text
GET    /api/cart
POST   /api/cart/items
PUT    /api/cart/items/:id
DELETE /api/cart/items/:id
```

### Orders

```text
POST   /api/orders
POST   /api/orders/buy-now
GET    /api/orders
GET    /api/orders/:id
GET    /api/admin/orders
GET    /api/admin/orders/:id
PUT    /api/admin/orders/:id/status
```

Administrator-only endpoints should be protected using authentication and role-based authorization middleware.

---

## 7. Database Architecture

PostgreSQL will store the application's persistent data.

### Main Tables

```text
users
├── id
├── name
├── email
├── password_hash
├── role
└── created_at

categories
├── id
├── name
└── description

products
├── id
├── category_id
├── name
├── description
├── price
├── stock_quantity
├── image_url
└── created_at

cart_items
├── id
├── user_id
├── product_id
└── quantity

orders
├── id
├── user_id
├── idempotency_key
├── subtotal
├── total_amount
├── status
├── status_updated_at
├── payment_method
├── delivery_address
├── created_at
└── updated_at

order_items
├── id
├── order_id
├── product_id
├── product_name
├── sku
├── quantity
└── unit_price
```

### Basic Relationships

```text
users
  │
  ├──────────< cart_items >────────── products
  │                                      │
  │                                      │
  └──────────< orders >──────< order_items
                                  │
                                  └──── products

categories
  │
  └──────────< products
```

The product name, SKU, and unit price stored in `order_items` are purchase-time snapshots. This prevents historical orders from changing when current product data is updated.

---

## 8. Authentication and Authorization

The application uses JWT-based authentication. Browser sessions are transported in an HTTP-only, same-site cookie rather than JavaScript-accessible storage.

### Customer Flow

```text
Register/Login
      │
      ▼
Backend validates credentials
      │
      ▼
JWT generated
      │
      ▼
Backend sets secure session cookie
      │
      ▼
Browser includes cookie with protected API requests
```

State-changing requests verify the request origin as an additional CSRF control. Production serves the frontend and `/api` from the same public origin.

### Roles

Two basic roles are sufficient:

- **Customer** — browse products, manage cart, place orders, and view their own orders.
- **Admin** — manage products, categories, inventory, and customer orders.

Passwords must never be stored as plain text. They should be hashed before being stored in PostgreSQL.

---

## 9. Main Application Flow

### Product Browsing

```text
Customer
   │
   ▼
React Products Page
   │
   ▼
GET /api/products
   │
   ▼
Python / Flask
   │
   ▼
PostgreSQL
   │
   ▼
Product Data
   │
   ▼
React Product Cards
```

### Checkout

```text
Customer
   │
   ▼
Shopping Cart
   │
   ▼
Checkout
   │
   ▼
POST /api/orders
   │
   ▼
Backend validates stock
   │
   ▼
Create Order + Order Items
   │
   ▼
Update Product Stock
   │
   ▼
PostgreSQL
   │
   ▼
Order Confirmation
```

Checkout uses Cash on Delivery for the MVP and creates a `pending` order. Administrators progress it through `confirmed`, `preparing`, `shipped`, and `delivered`; cancellation is allowed only while pending or confirmed and restores stock transactionally.

---

## 10. Deployment Architecture

The production application uses one public origin. Waitress serves Flask, which handles `/api` and serves the static React build and client-side deep links. Node.js is used to build React, not to run the production API. An HTTPS reverse proxy or hosting platform terminates TLS.

```text
Browser -> HTTPS host/proxy -> Waitress / Flask -> PostgreSQL
                                  |
                                  +-> client/dist (React assets and deep links)
```

During development, Vite runs on port 5173 and proxies `/api` to Flask on port 4000. PostgreSQL runs persistently; tests use separate random schemas. Existing schema migrations are reused unchanged.

Set `APP_ENV=production`, a stable `JWT_SECRET`, the public `CLIENT_ORIGIN`, and `DATABASE_URL`. The initial deployment uses one Waitress process because authentication limits default to process memory. Multiple instances require shared limiter storage. See the README for commands and verified TLS configuration.

### Environment Variables

Sensitive configuration should be stored as environment variables rather than committed to Git.

Example:

```text
DATABASE_URL=...
JWT_SECRET=...
```

The actual values must not be placed in the source code or committed to GitHub.

---

## 11. Security Considerations

The project only needs basic security appropriate for a student e-commerce application:

- Hash user passwords.
- Use JWT authentication for protected requests.
- Store browser JWTs only in secure, HTTP-only, same-site cookies and verify origins on state-changing requests.
- Protect admin routes with role-based authorization.
- Validate user input on the backend.
- Use parameterized Psycopg queries to prevent SQL injection.
- Never expose database credentials to the frontend.
- Use HTTPS in production.
- Store secrets in environment variables.
- Validate product stock before creating an order.

## 12. Recommended Project Structure

```text
florea-haven/
  client/                 React application
  backend/                Python Flask application, SQL migrations, pytest tests
  scripts/backend.mjs     Cross-platform Python launcher for npm commands
  docker-compose.yml      Local PostgreSQL
  docs/                   API contract and architecture decisions
  README.md
  package.json            Frontend and development orchestration
```

---

## 13. Scope Control

To keep the project feasible, the first version should focus on:

- Product catalog
- Product categories
- Search and filtering
- User registration and login
- Shopping cart
- Checkout
- Order history
- Order status
- Inventory management
- Admin product management

The following are **not required** for the initial student-project version:

- AI product recommendations
- Real-time courier GPS tracking
- Complex payment gateway integrations
- Microservices
- Real-time chat
- Advanced analytics
- Multiple external APIs
- Automated delivery integration

These can be added later if there is enough development time, ensure scalability and maintainability.

---

## 14. Architecture Summary

Floréa Haven follows a straightforward **three-layer architecture**:

1. **Presentation Layer** — React + Tailwind CSS provides the customer and administrator interfaces.
2. **Application Layer** — Python + Flask handles authentication, business logic, validation, and REST API requests.
3. **Data Layer** — PostgreSQL stores users, products, inventory, carts, and orders.

This architecture is simple enough for a student project while remaining organized, maintainable, and suitable for deployment on a Python WSGI host.
